A Flutter-based website raising awareness of rising femicide cases in Kenya. Inspired by "Missing in America," this project memorializes victims with their photo, name, age, case status, and story. Built using Flutter and Firebase, it aims to spotlight each case, demand justice, and provide a dignified digital space to remember the lives lost.
